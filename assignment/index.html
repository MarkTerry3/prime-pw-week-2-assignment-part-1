    <p>The way question 15 in the "aboutMe.js" file was written turned my brain
      to mush for a while. I'm still not convinced I understand what I was
      supposed to do, maybe im over thinking it. I wanted to put a >= on
      line 62 but instead went with == because thats what I interpreted
      the question wanted me to do. </p>
